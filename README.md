# React DApp Frontend for Crypto Staking Contracts

This is an example React app showcasing my web3 development skills in creating a frontend for crypto staking contracts. It provides users with the ability to browse different staking products, view individual products, and access the terms and FAQ for the contracts.

## Features

- **Index Page:** This page displays a list of all the crypto staking contracts available, with filters for selecting specific cryptos and staking methods.
- **Product Page:** This page shows detailed information about a specific staking product, including deposit/withdrawal options.
- **Terms and FAQ Page:** This page provides users with access to the terms and frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to the staking contracts. It supports markdown formatting for easy reading.

## Layout

The layout of this app is modular and easy to navigate. The index and product pages have fancy effects with mouse hover, including gradients for borders, adding a visually pleasing touch to the overall design.
